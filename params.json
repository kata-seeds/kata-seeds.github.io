If there's something you think would benefit all Kata Seeds, open a pull request on the template.\r\n\r\n### Name your Kata Seed\r\n\r\nIf you're only using the core language and standard library, the name should be `language-seed`. If you have to use/install a dependency to run the tests, the name should be `language-framework-seed` instead.\r\n\r\n### Just run `make`\r\n\r\nMakefiles are executable documentation. Someone can run `make` to run the tests, but also read the `Makefile` and see how the tests are run and dependencies are installed. Try your best to ensure someone can run `make` and get the tests running. The less someone has to do to get up and running, the more time they can spend learning the language instead of the tooling.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the behavior would be:\r\n\r\n* Run `make` the first time: Dependencies are installed, and the tests run.\r\n* Run `make` subsequent times: Dependencies are checked, and the tests run. The dependency checking should be near-instantaneous.\r\n\r\n### Commit exact dependency versions\r\n\r\nThe last thing someone wants to deal with when practicing a kata is bugs in dependencies. Pin the the dependencies to exact versions, or commit a dependency lock file if your language has one.\r\n","google":"UA-59852558-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
